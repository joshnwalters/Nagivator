# Nagivator
Mobile App


Nagivator is a service that will allow users to maximize their productivity by utilizing a unique set of metrics to track success. Rather than just setting a goal, Nagivator will have you list actions to be completed, and select a primary goal. When a session starts, you will be prompted at random intervals to report whether you are still making progress. Upon completion, you report what was completed during the session. If it wasn't your primary goal, no problem! Nagivator will track your progress on whatever task you completed.
