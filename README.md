# Nagivator
Set Sail!
Mobile App


Nagivator is a service that will allow users to maximize their productivity by utilizing a unique set of metrics to track success. Rather than just setting a goal, Nagivator will have you list actions to be completed, and select a primary goal. When a session starts, you will be prompted at random intervals to report whether you are still making progress. Upon completion, you report what was completed during the session. If it wasn't your primary goal, no problem! Nagivator will track your progress on whatever task you completed.

Nagivator is pirate themed, with an emphasis on customizable characters. You command your own ship, and navigate the hazardous waters of distraction on your way to complting your goals. Once your session is complete, you can view your ships log, where all the statistics for your previous sessions are logged. Feeling like you can't quite get your sea legs? A quick call to the commodore provides you with daily motivation to cast off the lines and set sail!
